## Hello world  (ʘ‿ʘ)╯
<!-- (⌐⊙_⊙) -->
### Short about me:
I have 5+ years of backend/fullstack experience, most of the time I prefer to work on prisma-express-react stack.

*I'm currently working as a freelancer, but I'm on the hunt for a new fullstack/backend opportunity or joining a good team.*
<!-- Ideally I'm looking for financial project/company.* -->

### Cool libraries/frameworks I'm curently learning:
- [lucid](https://github.com/ProtoDigitalUK/lucid) ‌ ‌ ‌ - A modern headless CMS using Kysely and SolidJS
- [kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely) - A type-safe typescript SQL query builder
- [d3fc](https://github.com/d3fc/d3fc) ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ - Components to build interactive charts with D3
